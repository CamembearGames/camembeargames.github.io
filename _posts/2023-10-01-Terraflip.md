## About the Game

In the distant land of Terraflip, the ruler has died. The four main families of the land do not wait long before claiming themselves as the new ruler. Will you be the next ruler of Terraflip ?

Terraflip is a competitive, tactical, tile placement and memory board game for up to 4 players set in a medieval land. In this eco-friendly board game you place and flip tiles to earn points. Each player has also access to basic and three special tiles. Once all players have played their tiles the player with the most points wins the game and becomes the next ruler of Terraflip.

Every component of the game, including the box, is entirely made out of engineered wood. It has been deliberately made without the use of plastic.
