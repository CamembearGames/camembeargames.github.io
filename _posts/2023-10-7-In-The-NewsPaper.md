In September I went to a local game festival in my hometown to present and have people try out my board game **Terraflip**. It was a great festival with close to 600 visitors over the weekend. 

I had a lot of fun playing with many different people and got some very positive feedback about the game.

On Saturday a journalist came by from the local newspaper and gave us an interview. The article was published last weekend and can be found [here](https://www.paris-normandie.fr/id455251/article/2023-10-06/terraflip-un-jeu-de-societe-invente-et-fabrique-par-des-fecampois).
