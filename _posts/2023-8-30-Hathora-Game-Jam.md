In August I participated in the Multiplayer Madness organised by Hathora (the full results can be found [here](https://itch.io/jam/multiplayer-madness-by-hathora/results)). I just had some very rougth knowledge of multiplayer game creation but using Godot 4 mutiplayer api made it really smooth.

I wanted to make a coop non violent game with simplified graphics and I am quite happy with the results after 9 intensive days of game creation.

And it paid off because the game ended NÂ°1 of the game jam :)

You can try the game on itch.io, it is still quite rougth and I do plan on realeasing a improved version later down the line:
